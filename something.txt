We know JavaScript
We can code in JavaScript
We can play with objects/arrays


But the data stored in DB is not in js objects or arrays.
In SQL, the data is stored in tables
In NoSQL, the data is stored in JSON/BSON

Either tables or JSON none of them is in JS to perform in CRUD operations.

To solve this problem, we have:
=> ORM -> Object Relational Mapper used for SQL which converts table rows & columns to JS objects
=> ODM -> Object Document Mapper used for NoSQL which converts JSON/BSON to JS objects

For example:
    - In SQL
        Get all users in SQL will be,
            SELECT * FROM USERS;

        SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=1

    - In NoSQL
        Get all users will be,
            Users.findAll()

        User.find({_id:1})
